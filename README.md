The Food and Beverage (F&B) industry has undergone notable transformations due to the rapid advancements in artificial intelligence (AI). An intriguing utilization of AI in this sector is the implementation of chatbots. These small yet advantageous bots are crafted to enhance customer service, streamline operations, and elevate the overall user experience. Therefore, our project aims to develop an AI-powered chatbot using a low-code or no-code platform tailored for the F&B industry. The chatbot under development is intended to serve as a reliable companion for customers, assisting them in navigating the menu, placing orders, making reservations, and providing feedback. Utilizing natural language processing (NLP) and AI-generated responses, the chatbot aims to comprehend and address customer inquiries accurately and contextually. To ensure optimal functionality, a structured design approach will be adopted, involving phased development, regular testing, and feedback collection from both customers and restaurant staff. The overarching objective for this chatbot is to exemplify the potential of AI in elevating customer engagement and streamlining operations within the F&B industry. This initiative is indeed stirring.
